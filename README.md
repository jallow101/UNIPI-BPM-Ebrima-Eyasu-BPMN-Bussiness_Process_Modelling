# Acting School Process Modeling Project

This repository contains a business process modeling project for an acting school, developed for the MPB 2024/25 course.

## 📋 Project Scenario

An acting school manages student course requests. The process includes:
- Student chooses a course
- Scheduling sessions with a teacher
- Lesson preparation and execution
- Payment and session repetition
- Option to start a new learning path at the end

## 🧩 Modeling Approach

The project includes:
- **BPMN Diagram**: High-level process design (`/bpmn/design.bpmn`)
- **Workflow Nets**: Petri net representations and analysis (`/pnets/*.pnml`)
- **Report**: Detailed explanation of design choices and formal analysis (`/report/BPM_REPORT.pdf`)
